            <li>Submission leads right to the page to be reviewed</li>
            <li>Can't tell if there is uppercase letters used for file names</li>
            <li>The contrast is good in some places, and I do not have trouble reading the clear text for the most
                part(Maybe the text in the about page could stand out a bit more and the pink text could be a bit
                brighter on the gallery page).</li>
            <li>The website most likely uses the standard .css file though I can’t check. </li>
            <li>As for repetition, there appears to be a constant theme of flowers on every page though they vary, and
                the contact page background is kind of different from the usual wallpaper like background.</li>
            <li>Pink colors are consistently used. The text is well aligned. For proximity, there is some order in the
                way you group things.</li>
            <li> Uses standard .css file The text is well aligned. For proximity, there is some order in the way you
                group things. </li>
            <li>The page has within it a header, main, and a footer and there is definitely a navigation menu.</li>
            <li>Header has brand name with text in h1: The site has a brand name in the Home Page which makes sense
                to me; I do not know if it is in the Header or if this needs to be in every page.</li>
            <li>There is a name of page maybe as an h2(not sure?) and does not include site or brand.</li>
            <li>There is the name of the person whom the website is for. This is not a consistent tagline. The
                creator(Lorie Cabrie) is consistently mentioned. Nothing like a slogan</li>
            <li>Page has footer with menu for user’s pages: There is a menu for user’s pages which makes sense(not
                necessarily in footer). No Accumulus or validation links provided. Please provide Accumulus and you
                should be good.</li>
            <li>Page has an entry or home page, navigation bar, and other pages.</li>
