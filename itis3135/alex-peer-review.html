        <ol>
            <li>Submission leads right to the page to be reviewed</li>
            <li>No upper case letters in the file names, I think</li>
            <li>Uses standard .css file
                <li>There is some contrast and repetition. You repeat the same font and colors in each link for the
                    repetition aspect.</li>
                <li>Everything seems aligned. </li>
                <li>I do think there is some order to your grouping such as Basics, Uses, and Resources. </li>
                <li>The contrast seemed good to me because I felt like I could read everything without much trouble.
                    The code in the programming examples don’t seem hard to read at all and just the comments in these
                    examples(which were marked by WAVE for poor contrast) are a little hard to read.</li>
            <li>Header, main, and footer are located as they should be. For (optional) nav for main menu between
                header and main: there is a nav element within the header.</li>
            <li>There does appear to be a tagline for the brand somewhere in a consistent location.("Test or Write
                Kotlin Code...!") </li>
            <li>No HTML and CSS validations. (A TA said Accumulus is enough) Menu for user’s pages are provided</li>
            <li>Page has specific requirements for Assignment 2 such as a Home page with actual content(text and
                images) as well as header, main, and footer named index.html with ids and classes.
            <li>The navigation bar appears to work because I can click on everything on the website.</li>
            <li>There are also links on the website with nav bars all situated on the top in the header.</li>
            <li>There are other pages included as well in the website with names and content. The nav bar is present
                in these webpages.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> The footer does seem to cover certain material such as
            in the tab: Android Applications in Kotlin. You might want to fix that so that the
            material is not hidden. The website looks neat, readable, and nicely laid out.</p>
